          Waste and pollution poses a global threat to various ecosystems and communities. 
          But what part does each and everyone of us take in that threat? 
          We can not know, except we get ourselves educated.
        </p>

        <h1>Reducing waste starts with learning about waste.</h1>

        <p>
          How much is thrown away, each day, on a continent like Europe? In a country like Germany? 
          In a city like MÃ¼nster? What do we throw away? Questions that can be answered just by looking 
          at some data.
