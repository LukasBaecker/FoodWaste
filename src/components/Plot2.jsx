            If we take a closer look at what exactly is thrown away (2019), we again observe a large amount
            of non reusable substances. The next contributors are, in that order, paper, biodegredable waste and
            packaging (also known as "yellow trash bag" or "yellow can"). <b>You can interact with the plot to
